    -- 1. Every venue needs to have at least 10 seats.

-- enforced without assertions or triggers, but were not enforced, if any?
-- Why not?
    -- None.

-- EXTRA CONSTRAINTS: What additional constraints that we didnâ€™t mention did you
-- enforce, if any?
    -- EXTRA CONSTRAINT1.
    -- There is no negative price ticket, as it doesn't make sense to give
    -- money to people who buy a ticket for some sections of the concerts.
    --
    -- EXTRA CONSTRAINT2.
    -- Purchase date is before(less than) the concert datetime.

    -- 3. All of ASSUMPTION0, ASSUMPTION1, ASSUMPTION2, ASSUMPTION3-2,
    -- ASSUMPTION4, and ASSUMPTION5 listed below are enforced.
    --
    -- 4. The following is a list of other constraints we thought to be trivial
    -- but not explicitly mentioned. These are often described in comments as
    -- to prevent the non-sense cases... etc.
        -- 1)
        -- A non existing user cannot buy a ticket.
        -- 2)
        -- type constraints (e.g., the maximum length of the characters)
        -- 3)
        -- A section cannot be in the non-existing venue.
        -- 4)
        -- A seat exists only if it is specified that the given venue has the
        -- corresponding and existing section.
        -- 5)
        -- A concert cannot be held at a non-existing venue.
        -- 6)
        -- A price of a ticket is declared only if an existing section specified
        -- is in a venue of an existing concert specified.
        -- 7)
        -- A user cannot buy a ticket of ticket-kind(concert-section) whose
        -- price is not declared.
            -- (Another interpretation: (i) A ticket-kind exists only if
            -- the price is declared. (ii) A ticket exists only if its
            -- ticket-kind exists and the seat is offered by that ticket-kind.
            -- (iii). A user cannot buy a non-existing ticket.)



-- ASSUMPTION: What assumptions did you make?
-- ASSUMPTION0.
-- Only valid phone numbers are given.
--
-- ASSUMPTION1.
-- There is at most one venue with each combination of city-street_address-venue
-- name, i.e., there is at most one venue that is in a certain city at a certain
-- street and has a certain name. There can be many with the sub combination.
-- We didn't make an assumption that there is at most one venue at city-street
-- address because there can be a small venue(like one floor of the building
-- (>10 seats still). And one can want to have one more venue in different floor
-- of the building. In that case, it sounds naming the new venue differently
-- from the existing one is necessary to prevent confusion.
--
-- ASSUMPTION2. Each ticket is for one unique concert seat.
-- (But this is quite mentioned, as "the price of a ticket depends the concert
-- and the section in which the seat is located in the venue.")
--
-- ASSUMPTION3. Each 1 seat that the concert offers(all seats of the venue in
-- our assignment) has exactly 1 corresponding ticket, given the price for that
-- ticket-kind is declared.
    -- ASSUMPTION3-1: (<1) at least 1 corresponding ticket, given ticket-kind.
        -- Because it is not reasonable to have unsellable seats for a ticket
        -- selling business, which would probably aim for the maximum profit.
        -- In the special case where the seller wants to have some "reserved
        -- seats":
            -- For the reserved seat, it is quite typical to have specific
            -- section just for the reserved seats. Then, the seller can set
            -- price of that reserved section of that concert free and make the
            -- corresponding purchases for all those seats, in advance. So this
            -- assumption is still valid to make.
        -- NOTE: This assumption is not enforced, but by having this assumption
        -- lets us keep just the purchased tickets instead of all possible
        -- tickets(each concert-section has all seats with the same prices for
        -- all seats).
    -- ASSUMPTION3-2: (>1) at most 1 corresponding ticket, given the ticket-kind
        -- Because it is non sense two or more people sitting in one seat during
        -- the concert.
    --
-- ASSUMPTION4. A purchase of a certain ticket can be made at most once, i.e.,
-- at most one user can buy each ticket.
    -- Followed by ASSUMPTION3-2, it is reasonable to make this assumption.
--
-- ASSUMPTION5. A venue only exists if the given owner exists.
    -- Because a venue with non-existing owner is not reasonable at all.
--
-- ASSUMPTION6. The same phone number is given in the same format.
    -- TYPE phone_number allows various formats of phone number because in the
    -- real app, there should be a different reason to choose certain format
    -- more preferable than the other(e.g., readability, space(length), etc.
    -- depending on the use), but not to have so many possible values for the
    -- same phone number in the real world.
    -- Note, this is left as a front-end's responsibility, instead of being
    -- enforced here.
        -- This is also reasonable since for a different front-end
        -- (or an actual app), it should be their choice and responsibility to
        -- allow certain formats only, or at least check if the same number is
        -- given in a unified format. So everytime before putting the value into
        -- a database, front-end would need a checker.
    -- This assumption was mainly to prevent the case where the same phone
    -- number is given in multiple formats so that the ddl cannot keep each
    -- phone number unique even though it is PRIMARY KEY of the table.(it will
    -- consider those two differently, which may an unwanted behaviour).
    -- Still, this is still a reasonable assumption to make too as there would
    -- be no point of having various forms of the same value in the database,
    -- if they will eventually considered to be the same.


-- < TYPE(DOMAIN) phone_number >
-- The possible values for the type phone number.
-- It is restricted to only contain number, hyphen, space, or at most one plus
-- sign in front (for international number).
-- Using ASSUMPTION0, we have constructed checker that:
-- COUNTRY CODE 1 :
-- For phone numbers of Canada or U.S., which uses country code (+)1, it has a
-- format for canada after optional +1, 3 area code, followed by 4 digits, and
-- the 4 digits. We allow to have hyphens or spaces.
-- OTHER COUNTRY CODE (not 1) :
-- For these, it must include the country code(which has longest length of 3)
-- with the optional + in front of it. Followed by a country code, we allow from
-- the shortest length(4) digits to the longest length(15) of digits of phone
-- number plus at most 3 hyphens or spaces, each being in between digits.
-- Combining, in maximum: 1 plus sign + 3 digits of country code + 15 digits +
-- 3 hyphens or spaces each being between numbers = we allowed 1+3+15+3 = 22
-- Default value is set to NULL for the future use where phone_number is not a
-- required field but optional(Unlike our example, where we force NOT NULL).

-- < TABLE Prices >
-- A price of a ticket-kind(concert, section).
-- As "(*) the price of a ticket depends the *concert* and the *section* in

-- information and (2) a section information for each price.
--
-- 1) Concert Information
--      vid: a venue(id) where a concert is held
--      datetime: date and time of a concert
-- (vid, datetime) references Concert(vid, datetime). This is to make sure that
-- we keep prices of (the section at) the *existing concert*. Note this can be
-- enforced as (vid, datetime) was a primary key in Concert table.
--
-- 2) Section Information
--      section_id: a section where this ticket kind belongs to.
            -- we do not need to keep seat, as (*). It would be redundant if we
            -- kept specific seat information as all concert-section
            -- combinations have the same price.
-- (section_id, vid) references Section(section_id, vid). This is to ensure that
-- the price is recorded for the existing section and it is in the venue that
-- the concert is happening(which is specified as vid)(**). Referencing just the
-- section id is not sufficient. We need vid to prevent the case when someone
-- tries to record a price of a ticket to a concert and a section but the
-- section does not belong to a venue that the concert is happening.
-- And this is why we had declared (section_id, vid) UNIQUE in Section table
-- even though it is automatically unique with PRIMARY KEY section_id.
--
-- Design decision:
-- Note we could have used a new attribute concert_id as a primary key instead
-- of carrying (vid, datetime) all the time to refer a specific concert. If we
-- had done that, we wouldn't need datetime information, which is unnecessary.
-- However, as this is the only place we would need a concert information and
-- in here, we still need vid(venue information) to make sure (**), we need
-- vid and cid instead of vid and datetime. On the other hand, making cid is
-- just adding one more additional attribute(concert_id) to Concert table.
-- Therefore, we have decided to set (vid, datetime) as primary key of Concert
-- and use the combination of two in this table as well.
--
-- If we had used cid, we will need a checker in this table using subquery
-- as:
-- constraint sectionNotInConcert
--                         check ( section in (SELECT section
--                                         FROM Concert JOIN Seat

--                                         WHERE Concert.cid = Ticket.cid) )
-- However, use of a subquery in checker like this is not supported by psql.
-- So we had to find the other way, which was the way we did: to carry vid as a
-- part of information of the concert. We know this can cause a redundancy,
-- (not about the magic trick but we should input redundant data for example)
-- but we chose to enforce a constraint as we thought it is more important in
-- this case.
--
--      price: a price of a ticket kind in $
            -- type is float instead of integer in case the price is specified

-- as negative price for a ticket doesn't make sense(EXTRA CONSTRAINT1). There
-- can be some free concerts, so we have decided to allow price to be 0.
-- PRIMARY KEY of this table is a combination (vid, datetime, section_id),
