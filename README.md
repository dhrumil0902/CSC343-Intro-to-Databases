# CSC343-Intro-to-Databases
### Assignments Done in CSC343
### All assignments were done in a group of 2
## Assignment 1
- Read a new relational schema, and determine whether or not a particular     instance is valid with respect to that schema
- Apply the individual techniques for writing relational algebra queries and   integrity constraints that we learned in class
- Combine the individual techniques to solve complex problems
- Identify problems that cannot be solved using relational algebra

## Assignment 2
- Read and interpret a schema
- Write SQL queries on this schema
- Embed SQL in Python using Psycopg2
- Design datasets to test the schema
- Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation
- Recognize limits to the expressive power of standard SQL

## Assignment 3 (Final Project)
### Part 1
- We had to create our own relational database
- The prompt we were given "Suppose a new company is trying to break into     the concert ticket business and you are designing the database back-end     for their app. Create a relational schema to support entering and storing             information for concerts, venues and purchasing of tickets "

- Identified tradeoffs that must be made when designing a schema in the     relational model, and make reasonable choices
- Expressed a schema in SQLâ€™s Data Definition Language
- Reasoned about functional dependencies
- Created tests (q1.sql - q4.sql) and displayed them in demo.txt
### Part 2
- Apply BCNF and 3NF decompositions on a given set of relations and FDs
